	 * (A)
	 * 1. Does the line of code type check? 
	 * -Yes
	 * 2. If so, what is the output?
	 * -The output is the string "C.foo"

	 * (B)
	 * 1. Does the line of code type check? 
	 * -No
	 * 2. If so, what is the output?

	 * Recall that the static type of i is I and the dynamic type is C. 
	 * What does this exercise tell you about how precise subtyping is? 
	 * In particular, is there code that is safe but rejected by Javaâ€™s type system?
